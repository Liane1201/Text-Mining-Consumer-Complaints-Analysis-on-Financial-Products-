I 've worked with XXXX XXXX in the past, and I trusted that she would help me obtain a new home loan as she did for previously. The presenting issue is that for nine months XXXX XXXX with Caliber Home Loans used deceptive, predatory lending practices in an attempt to obtain a home loan on my behalf that she knew I would not qualify to get. To explain further I just learned from a more reputable lender that I am only qualified to purchase a home loan for {$300000.00} when for 9 months XXXX XXXX with Caliber Homes provided pre-approvals for 4 different home in the range of {$400000.00} to {$640000.00} when she knew that I was in no way capable of obtaining a loan in that range. She knowingly continued to deceive me knowing that I was selling my current home, about to rent and own a new home that she provided a preapproval to purchase knowing that my XXXX only showed that I made {$39000.00}. She just admitted to this omission after she ran my credit twice, allowed me to go forward with putting my previous home up for sale and assisted in the sale of my last house, she knew I would lose a {$2000.00} deposit on a home I can not afford to purchase and never would have been able to buy because she has had access to my XXXX since XXXX. I took a loss of {$80000.00} on the purchase of my old house, lost my {$2000.00} deposit on the new home, {$1000.00} in moving expenses and the unfortunate owner of the house I am being forced to vacate is also impacted as his house has been off the market for 3 months because of her lies, deception an omission. Additionally, she stopped corresponding with me after she finally told me the truth. This is no how you treat someone you called "" like family. '' Her tactics to use me to deceptively obtain a loan she knew I would not afford has harmed me financially and emotionally.  Now, I have to find a place to live again ( I just moved in XXXX because of her lies and sold my house ) as not to disrupt my children as well as deal with a homeowner who was also financially harmed. All of the above events took place from XXXX XXXX until XXXX XXXX. Additionally, Caliber Home loans serviced my previous home loan that another lender told me I should n't have received either because I did not qualify and they did not pay my taxes on that house.

136,"FIRST HAWAIIAN, INC.",Company believes complaint represents an opportunity for improvement to better serve consumers,Closed with explanation,2417043,"This is a complaint against First Hawaiian Bank for its grossly incompetent management of its supposedly new and improved website. I 've been a customer since approximately 2003, and I have never had problems with my account as bad as I have in the last few months with the roll-out of the new site. 

Tonight, I spent one hour trying very hard to access my account online and then trying to transfer funds. Along the way, I made two phone calls to FHB Online where I spoke with a total of four representatives. Not one of them had even the slightest clue of how badly the site was performing. Specifically, every time I tried to perform ANY operation, the site automatically displayed an error message. When I tried to make an external transfer FHB Online stopped the attempted transaction and said it would send a code to my phone for verification. But FHB never called my phone -- even after an hour. The broken system did nearly the same thing when I tried to ( re ) add my XXXX account as an external account. FHB displayed a message that my XXXX account credentials were invalid. ( Yet these were the same credentials that I have been using on my XXXX account for years. So there was nothing wrong with my XXXX online ID, password, or pin. ) But far and away, the very worst issue was my truly sad experience with "" XXXX '' in the Online Banking Department. ( She said it was bank policy to refuse to provide her last name or even an employee number. ) Despite the incredible amount of time XXXX and I spent on the phone with her asking me the same questions over-and-over again, she could not understand that the FHB site was not performing as she expected it to. For example, she insisted there would be a blue arrow in front of my name. After asking me about this three times, I refused to answer the same question anymore. I had enough with the FHB site and its employees who were deeply in the dark about the site 's issues. 

There is obviously something seriously wrong with the FHB website. It is not performing adequately. While I was on the phone with FHB, I had absolutely no problem accessing my XXXX and XXXX accounts. So the issue is not my connection -- and hopefully not even my XXXX browser. Clearly my access to funds through the site is blocked. But I am far more concerned with FHB 's employees ' inability to troubleshoot, assist, or even acknowledge something is wrong.",Consent provided,No,2017-04-04T00:00:00.000,2017-04-04T00:00:00.000,"Account opening, closing, or management",Bank account or service,VA,,Checking account,Web,Servicemember,Yes,220XX

I received ZERO communication via email, regular mail, or via phone from Experian that I had a recurring service from them and was being charged to my XXXX XXXX credit card. 

I had no access to the service either, as again, I never received ANY communication from them, so I never received a username and password or any instructions on how to access the recurring service. I, to this day, have not used the service they signed me up for, and since it 's just a website with a credit report on it, never received anything from them, nor did they incur any costs since nothing was ever delivered. 

I did, on a one time basis, access my credit report in XX/XX/XXXX, after the XXXX hack. That charge was for {$4.00}. I assume that they signed me up for the recurring service then, and deceptively did not CLEARLY state I was signing up for a service. 

I discovered the issue last year in XX/XX/XXXX when I reviewed my XXXX XXXX credit card statements and realized the recurring charges. I initially attempted to contact Experian, but could not reach them after being on hold over the phone for over an hour. So I then sent a dispute to XXXX XXXX XXXX. After several weeks ( was traveling to see family over XXXX ) with no response from XXXX XXXX, I contacted them again to dispute the charges. Yesterday, I finally received several emails from XXXX XXXX indicating that the charges would be rebilled to my account. 

I then contacted Experian again this morning by calling XXXX and was on hold for over 1 hour and 30 minutes ( I have a screenshot to prove it ) and was finally able to get a customer service agent on the phone. 

The customer service agent I spoke with is named 'XXXX ' on team 'XXXX ' within the customer service center. This agent said that they could not remove the charges. I then spoke with his manager 'XXXX ' (  agent # XXXX ) and she would not remove the charges either. 

The charges total {$170.00}. The charges occurred from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. Please see the attached screenshot of the charges from my online XXXX XXXX account.",Consent provided,,2018-01-14T00:00:00.000,2018-01-14T00:00:00.000,Credit monitoring or identity theft protection services,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",CA,Billing dispute for services,Credit reporting,Web,,Yes,919XX

Then it reported that I had won a caribbean Cruise. I hung up and tried again. I was cut off 3 times before I was placed in a que.

What I wanted to know was why they believe I already asked for a report. I have not contacted Transunion for more than 10 years. I have opened a new savings account recently, so maybe the bank asked for my report. But does another agency asking for my report make my personal request null and void?

When I contacted Ocwen to have them remove the PMI on my loan I was originally told my loan had not crossed the 80 % loan to value threshold. I explained that their numbers were incorrect and that the original loan documentation proves it. They rechecked the numbers and agreed that I was at ~77 % loan to value. When I requested they remove the PMI charges, they said I would have to pay them to have an appraisal done in order to remove this. I offered to provide alternate valuations ( State tax appraisals ) that show my house has appreciated in value, but they said they can not accept anything other than an appraisal through their vendor. This is a clear case of extortion. I have met the requirements to remove PMI based on the original loan terms and have offered to provide current, alternate documentation to the value of my home, but they will not accept anything other than a vendor of theirs being paid for an appraisal. When I asked them when they would automatically remove the PMI charges, they said they would not remove them unless I paid them the fee to have the appraisal done. I feel like this in not only an extreme anti-consumer practice, but a clear case of extortion since my only options are pay them the appraisal fee or pay the PMI forever.",Consent provided,,2017-08-14T00:00:00.000,2017-08-15T00:00:00.000,Trouble during payment process,Mortgage,TX,,Conventional home mortgage,Web,,Yes,775XX

I sold that property to move into a XXXX, XXXX in XXXX, IA. I contacted Moving Matters, a moving company that specializes in moving seniors into retirement communities. They pack, help downsize, and their designers set up your apartment in the community. I had a cable box, modem and all the hookups needed for the above service. I assumed it was all packed and taken to the XXXX. I checked with the moving company and they said their records showed all items moved as promised. However they told me I would not have needed a cable box at XXXX as the cable was sourced through XXXX. If a resident had a flat screen no cable box was needed. I know I was using the same modem as I used in XXXX or one very similar. ( Model Name-XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) I lived at XXXX very close to a year and for personal reasons decided not to stay after my grace period of 365 days. In all the time I lived there I was never asked about the cable box or any of the equipment issued to me in XXXX. I still maintained the internet and phone so XXXX had my address and contact information. 

I had lived in XXXX for at least four or five months when I got my first collection letter. This letter was my first knowledge of this debt. 
Date XX/XX/XXXX ; Original Creditor-XXXX ; Account # XXXX I have the Modem ( Model Name-XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) in question and a HDMI cable that is XXXX 's I think. I do n't know what happened to the cable box from XXXX. Common sense tells me it was in my apartment when XXXX set up my XXXX system. I was not missing anything other possessions that I had marked for the moving company. 

I have several problems with this claim. 

1. If it is customary to return these items and the information I received with the present system made it clear that is the case, why was I not asked for the XXXX Cable box, Modem and other hardware when I left XXXX? 

2. What was used to hook up my system in XXXX? I would like to see the records of the installation in XXXX to check the Serial # of the modem used against the serial # of the modem installed in XXXX.

I have never opened an account with them, nor have they sent me a credit card statement. The only thing that I have received from them in the last few months is multiple offers for new lines of credit. Their negligence in regards to this matter has caused me major XXXX and XXXX. This is my last resort. I will be going to legal counsel this next week if this is not resolved. I also wanted to forward this over to the CFPB for investigation on your end. I live at a home that I have owned for the past few years. I find that Citibank has acted in complete negligence or with fraudulent intent if I have not received any information in regards to a matter that I have local law enforcement looking into. Citibank tried to blame this on the local post office. The post office actually contacted me in regards to this to indicate that they have investigated the matter and found that no one is forwarding my mail to another address or anything that they can control. The local police department reached out to me and are currently investigating this crime that has been committed against me. What does Citibank do? They call me twice. Once to try and sell me a "" credit monitoring package '' which I am not interested in. Why would I want someone who obviously ca n't figure out how to issue a line of credit to the correct person in the first place monitoring my credit? The second call was at XXXX XXXX in the evening when I was trying to navigate on a road that I was unfamiliar with in TN. I had to disconnect the call. I spoke with some gentleman anothe time and he said that someone would get back to me. No one ever did. Overall my complaint is 1. I never took opened a line of credit with this company. I filed a police report. They do not want to acknowledge this. This was caught by other lenders XXXX XXXX ( who I had an account with previously ) and XXXX and they decided not to issue the line of credit. 2. Absolutely no one will call me back in regards to this. 3. From everything else that has gone on with other companies, I have no other believe than that someone internally over at Citibank opened a line of credit under my name and they are refusing to acknowledge this.

627,AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,,Closed with monetary relief,2585610,American Express. i was approved for a Blue Cash Everyday with a 10 % bonus on restaurant purchases. A {$100.00} statement credit after spending {$1000.00} and 0 % interest for 12 months. The card was opened on XXXX XXXX 2017 I made {$130.00} in restaurant purchases between XX/XX/XXXXand XX/XX/XXXX when my first statement cut. On my second statement I spent {$460.00} on restaurant spending. On my third statement I made {$370.00} in restaurant purchases the statement ending XX/XX/XXXX. In the terms and conditions and other places it says sometimes it takes two billing periods to receive bonus Rewards and on chat I have been told 8 weeks anyway I made my first restaurant purchase around XX/XX/XXXX that 's almost 3 months ago and I have not received one dime of the 10 % I 'm supposed to receive on restaurant purchases. If it takes 2 billing Cycles to receive bonus rewards that I should have received bonus rewards for my first statement or if it 's eight weeks I 've should have received a lot more ... .... my main concern is that there have been several complaints online that have said they have signed up for these 10 % bonuses at XXXX and restaurant purchases and have said that Amex has tried to get out of paying them or never paid them saying they did n't sign up for the offer. I have chatted online 5 times with customer service I have spoken to customer service on the phone once or twice I 've been told this has been escalated in a chat to some special investigation team to find out why I have n't gotten paid for my rewards this was on XX/XX/XXXX I asked why is this taking so long I mean I could figure out how much I 've spent in restaurant purchases in 5 minutes but has been almost 6 weeks since they sent it to this investigation team. I was not going to make a complaint until the last statement posted and it was the third statement that I have received. XXXX statements past the first still no bonus rewards from the first statement. I have had a few credit cards and i have not seen this kind of delay on bonus Rewards being deposited into the account. The latest I 've ever seen is the next billing statement. Due to my observations of investigating online I feel concerned that Amex is delaying and delaying because they want you to spend as much as you can on the car and then tell you you did n't sign up for the bonus I 've read that several times. I made my first restaurant purchase about 3 months ago and have not receive 10 % on rewards on my card yet due to my concern I have stopped spending on this credit card at restaurants for fear that they will never pay me on my 10 % .. I believe Amex does this on purpose if the customer does n't think they 're going to get the 10 % then they stop using the card for the 10 % so then they save money by not having to pay you the 10 % on the restaurant purchases because you stopped doing it. It supposedly takes forever to do an investigation on my restaurant spending when you can see on my statements and online immediately how much I 've spent on restaurant purchases. I just do not trust them they say it could take up to 2 billing Cycles to receive Rewards but now it 's past 2 billing cycles and almost to the Third. I did receive the {$100.00} bonus for spending {$1000.00} in 3 months but that took two months to get paid buy a supervisor. but before I asked about the XXXX dollar bonus the supervisor said he could not do that but then a month later another supervisor did. You In the last 3 months I 've spent a little over {$1000.00} in restaurant spending and have yet to receive one penny from that rewards promotion. Another customer said she spent {$1000.00} at XXXX and Amex told her that she did n't sign up for the bonus when I chat online the customer service representative says they can see the restaurant purchases that I have made but they had to send my account to a special investigation team to figure out my restaurant purchases when a regular customer service representative can see it right on their computer screen I just do n't believe their excuses I believe if I did nothing I would never receive any rewards paid out. I have not received any bonuses on restaurant purchases there 's no reason to believe that they would start paying me on the 10 % now. I know AMEX has been fined by the government in the past for issues such as these.,Consent provided,,2017-07-26T00:00:00.000,2017-07-26T00:00:00.000,"Other features, terms, or problems",Credit card or prepaid card,OK,Problem with rewards from credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Web,Servicemember,Yes,730XX

THEY HAVE NO VALID CONTRACT WITH LAWFUL ELEMENTS OF CONTRACT,!!! THEIR RESPONSE IS TOTAL XXXX!!! TOTAL NONSENSE!!! 

SHOW ME A CURRENT VALID CONTRACT WITH MY WET INK SIGNATURE!!! 
SHOW IT TO ME!!!! AND STOP XXXX AROUND WITH YOUR TACTICTS OF CRIMINAL DECEPTIVE BEHAVIOR, THAT AINT MY XXXX DEBT AND YOU KNOW IT!!! 

PARTS OF A LAWFUL CONTRACT 1. Parties competent to contract The parties to a contract should be competent, being of the age of consent, of sound mind, not disqualified from contracting by any law to which s/he is subject. A flaw in capacity may be due to minority, lunacy, idiocy, drunkenness or kind. The parties should be of like kind, being either artificial Legal Entity and artificial Legal Entity, or living Man/Woman and living Man/Woman, allowing more than two parties but never a mixture of these kinds. 
2. Free and genuine consent The consent of the parties to the agreement must be free and genuine. The consent of the parties should not be obtained by misrepresentation, fraud, undue influence, coercion or mistake. If the consent is obtained by any of these means, then the contract is not valid or lawfully enforceable. 
3. Full disclosure When negotiating a contract, full disclosure is the act of providing all material information, or telling the "" whole truth '', about any matter which may influence the decision-making of the other party or parties before they decide to enter into a contract. 
4. Sufficient consideration The consideration is something of value possessed by the parties that is brought to the contract table. This something of value is bargained for and given in exchange for a promise or a performance. The parties must each receive a benefit and each suffer a detriment. To be enforceable, a contract must have sufficient consideration. A contract is unenforceable if it has insufficient or unequal consideration without agreement. 
5. Certainty of terms The Terms and Conditions of the contract must be fully disclosed and agreed upon, and must be certain and fixed, i.e. not variable as with interest rates. 
6. Meeting of the minds A meeting of the minds "" consensus ad idem '', occurs between the parties when they recognise each other, understand their mutual obligations, and agree. This meeting of minds can only occur between like kinds, being Legal Entity with Legal Entity, or Man/Woman with Man/Woman. A corporation and another corporation may enter into contract by way of accommodation parties, and a sentient being and another sentient being may enter into a contract directly, but a corporation and a sentient being together can not enter into a contract as they are not of the same and equal kind. 
7. Signatures or autographs Written contracts between Legal Entity actors must carry the wet ink signatures of the parties, each wet ink signature being anaccommodation from a Man/Woman. Written contracts between living Men/Women must carry the wet ink autographs of the parties, and/or living identification such as a thumbprint. Living standing is recognised by a thumbprint, or more often by an unambiguous declaration with the autograph, such as authorised agent written below. 
8. Privity of contract A contract exists only between the parties. No third-party can obtain rights contained within a contract, or buy or sell a contract, without the express permission of the original parties.

884,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",,Closed with explanation,2372286,"On XX/XX/2017, I made a {$1000.00} credit card payment to my student loan provider, Navient ( ex XXXX ) and asked the customer service rep. to cover the total amount due ( {$580.00} ) and apply the amount left over ( {$410.00} ) to a specific loan, since that loan has the highest interest rate ( 4.25 % ) and it 's the smallest loan. Mysteriously, the amount left over was not applied to that loan, but rather to the largest loan ( {$32000.00} ) I have with the highest interest rate ( 4.25 % ). 
I pointed out the problem from XX/XX/2017 to another rep. on XX/XX/XXXX and she told me that the reallocation of {$410.00} from the highest loan to the smallest loan would be processed by XX/XX/2017. 
I messaged Navient 's live online messaging service on XX/XX/XXXX to explain the problem and the rep. told me that they were looking into it and that it should be reallocated by the following week. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I called to yet again follow up and also make another payment, but nothing regarding the misallocation from XX/XX/2017 had been done. I received no correspondence regarding this matter. I pointed out the problem to another rep. this time and he told me that the reallocation of {$410.00} from the smallest loan to the largest loan would be processed at the latest by XX/XX/2017. 
On XX/XX/2017, I called yet again regarding situation from XX/XX/2017 and also to make a further payment. I explained the situation to yet another rep. and received his permission to record our conversation, and then made a payment with him. After the payment, he transferred me to a manager, XXXX. He denied me permission to record our conversation. I was very distraught and explained to him why I was upset. I then threatened legal action and to write a formal complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau if I did n't receive some form of written correspondence telling me they were dealing with the situation by the end of that day. He acted tough and told me that the "" Monetary Department '' dealt with these matters and that no one from that department was in. I was on the telephone for 2 hours as both he and and the other rep. put me on hold "" looking '' for someone. 
After that phone call, the situation turned extremely weird. When I went to log into my online Navient account an hour later, the access was denied and I had to "" re-register '' with a new login-name and password. After re-registering, I noticed that, although I made a payment on that day ( XX/XX/2017 ) totaling {$700.00}, that sum was also never applied to my loans and the amount of my smallest loan actually increased by {$240.00} ; my payment "" disappeared '' and I have no idea what the increased amount of {$240.00} is. What happened here? 
Even though I CONTINUOUSLY call and ask for clarification, my requests are met with a lack of accountability and customer service representatives who seem to lie about my situation. I want to know where my money went and why more money has been added to one of my loans. 
I can prove all of this, since I record all correspondence and take before and after screenshots of my payments.",Consent provided,No,2017-03-05T00:00:00.000,2017-03-05T00:00:00.000,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Student loan,MD,Trouble with how payments are handled,Non-federal student loan,Web,,Yes,227XX

926,"loanDepot.com, LLC",Company believes complaint is the result of an isolated error,Closed with monetary relief,2773026,Our mortgage payment to LoanDepot was {$1200.00} all of XX/XX/XXXX. We set up an automatic payment of {$1300.00} per month to cover this. When we received our XX/XX/XXXX statement outlining the payment due for XX/XX/XXXX we were shocked to discover that our payment due had jumped to {$1800.00}. We have a fixed rate mortgage that includes escrow and were never advised of this kind of increase being possible. Our first call was made around XX/XX/XXXX. The loan officer that closed this loan would only tell us to call customer service to discuss. Customer service was not able to give us an answer until our sixth call. During one of these calls we were advised that the website we had been going to was not the right one and that they had just changed their site. Then we were told that our taxes had gone up so our escrow was insufficient for the end of year taxes that were due. Our county assessor advised us that our taxes had actually gone down. We decided to pay {$730.00} to avoid any issues and expected to see our regularly scheduled payment of {$1300.00} come out on XX/XX/XXXX. We were again shocked to see that both {$730.00} and {$1800.00} had been drafted by LoanDepot. On XX/XX/XXXX Several e-mails requesting that someone from LoanDepot call us back ( one to each individual listed when we sign in to our account on LoanDepot.com and one to customer service ) were responded to with requests that we call customer service or e-mail a different customer service e-mail address. One even said that they do n't draft payments!!! We did not want to call customer service because that was how we ended up in this situation in the first place. We did not receive a phone call from anyone so we called. It took 15 minutes to get a live person on the phone. On this call the representative made a similar claim about our taxes going up. When asked whether this kind of increase seemed normal she only said that it could happen. When asked for details about our previous conversation with customer service the agent claimed the calls were recorded but claimed she did n't see any notes about that conversation. We asked that they review that recording to find out if their representative had advised us that the automatic payment would be {$1800.00}. We did not agree to our automatic payment increasing beyond {$1300.00}. The customer service representative claimed that the payment would match the statement and that this was in the documentation about the automatic payment. We asked to talk with someone that was involved in analyzing our taxes and adjusting our escrow and were told that they do not take phone calls but we could e-mail yet another customer service department. This e-mail was met with an automated response on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX that said our question had been received and we should expect a response within 24 hours. It has been well over 24 hours as of the writing of this complaint and we have not received any further communication from LoanDepot.,Consent provided,,2018-01-05T00:00:00.000,2018-01-05T00:00:00.000,Trouble during payment process,Mortgage,MO,,Conventional home mortgage,Web,,Yes,633XX

Parties competent to contract The parties to a contract should be competent, being of the age of consent, of sound mind, not disqualified from contracting by any law to which s/he is subject. A flaw in capacity may be due to minority, lunacy, idiocy, drunkenness or kind. The parties should be of like kind, being either artificial Legal Entity and artificial Legal Entity, or living Man/Woman and living Man/Woman, allowing more than two parties but never a mixture of these kinds. 
2. Free and genuine consent The consent of the parties to the agreement must be free and genuine. The consent of the parties should not be obtained by misrepresentation, fraud, undue influence, coercion or mistake. If the consent is obtained by any of these means, then the contract is not valid or lawfully enforceable. 
3. Full disclosure When negotiating a contract, full disclosure is the act of providing all material information, or telling the "" whole truth '', about any matter which may influence the decision-making of the other party or parties before they decide to enter into a contract. 
4. Sufficient consideration The consideration is something of value possessed by the parties that is brought to the contract table. This something of value is bargained for and given in exchange for a promise or a performance. The parties must each receive a benefit and each suffer a detriment. To be enforceable, a contract must have sufficient consideration. A contract is unenforceable if it has insufficient or unequal consideration without agreement. 
5. Certainty of terms The Terms and Conditions of the contract must be fully disclosed and agreed upon, and must be certain and fixed, i.e. not variable as with interest rates. 
6. Meeting of the minds A meeting of the minds "" consensus ad idem '', occurs between the parties when they recognise each other, understand their mutual obligations, and agree. This meeting of minds can only occur between like kinds, being Legal Entity with Legal Entity, or Man/Woman with Man/Woman. A corporation and another corporation may enter into contract by way of accommodation parties, and a sentient being and another sentient being may enter into a contract directly, but a corporation and a sentient being together can not enter into a contract as they are not of the same and equal kind. 
7. Signatures or autographs Written contracts between Legal Entity actors must carry the wet ink signatures of the parties, each wet ink signature being anaccommodation from a Man/Woman. Written contracts between living Men/Women must carry the wet ink autographs of the parties, and/or living identification such as a thumbprint. Living standing is recognised by a thumbprint, or more often by an unambiguous declaration with the autograph, such as authorised agent written below. 
8. Privity of contract A contract exists only between the parties. No third-party can obtain rights contained within a contract, or buy or sell a contract, without the express permission of the original parties.

990,NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION,Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,Closed with explanation,2398842,"My husband lost his bank card and didnt know it. Navy Federal sent my him a text in regards to a {$8.00} purchase and that was it. Once we were able to check our account there had been XXXX transactions conducted with his card and a pin number over the course of 3 days. This an account that my husband and I solely have for the purpose of us saving money. This is the only joint account we have and do n't use it on a daily basis at all. The XXXX transactions consisted of XXXX checks being written to my husband and deposited into our account. Of course it later came back that the checks were not legit. So at this time Navy Federal is saying that my husband and I are responsible for the estimated {$2000.00} overdrafts in our checking and savings account. Due to the fact that the transactions were done by a pin number they are basically saying that they have done their investigation and we are liable. The fact that checks were not signed by my husband, location of the transactions and the irregular amount of transactions conducted in such a short time frame was not taking under consideration. So almost every Navy Federal calls myself or my husband seeking payment for these fraudulent actives that has occurred to our bank account. I honestly believe that it maybe a Navy Federal employee who did this due to the fact that fake Navy Federal checks were used and that they had some way of getting my husbands pin number or even able to manipulate the system in to believe its my husbands pin. My husband did not write his pin number down or give it to anybody. He uses the same pin number for all of his accounts so there is no need to write it down which Navy Federal is assuming happened or that he gave it to someone. I his wife is the only other person who knows this pin number. So needless to say DO NOT TRUST NAVY FEDERAL WITH YOUR MONEY!!!! They have done absolutely nothing to help me resolve this issue but give me the run around and play games. I get new and different answers every time I call and they refuse to let me speak to a supervisor, investigator, or security personnel to help me understand how they came up with the conclusion in which they did.",Consent provided,No,2017-03-22T00:00:00.000,2017-03-22T00:00:00.000,Deposits and withdrawals,Bank account or service,MD,,Checking account,Web,,Yes,207XX
